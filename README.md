# Rez MCP Server

If you wanna try out REZ MCP Server. Clone the repo and install the deps with uv.

Then run,
```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

Add streamable-http mcp to your chat client.

You can even skip the installation steps and try using the hosted REZ MCP Server instead [https://mcp.kottesh.xyz/rez/mcp](https://mcp.kottesh.xyz/rez/mcp)
